<h1>About</h1>
<p>Hi there! I have a passion for designing and animation on the web. I have 6 years in designing and developing web content. I specialize in visual and creative facilitation, in bringing your bright ideas into focus and structure so that you and your team can go forth and conquer. I’ll collaborate with you to design a meeting that’s guaranteed to produce tangible results and an action plan. Together, we’ll create the space for something momentous - even something that could change the world.I also help creative entrepreneurs find clarity and organization with their ideas and projects. I’m like a coach with markers, creating a large visual map--and in some cases a visual business plan--while we’re talking on the phone, complete with action steps forward. 
Clients who I’ve helped articulate their vision include GE, Accenture, Victoria's Secret, Intercontinental Hotel Group, Burt's Bees, The American Insititute of Architects, GE Energy, The Centers for Disease Control, National Wildlife Federation, American Geophysical Union (AGU), Scott & White, SC Johnson, and ConAgra.A few more things about me: I cut my teeth strategizing, planning and facilitating conversations on environmental issues for the nonprofit community. I have a ton of experience in politics. And I continue to work for healthy rivers as a board chair for a statewide nonprofit. As a visual facilitator, I’m specializing in sustainability issues and I have a lot of knowledge to bring to the table. So think of me as a creative visual thinker and environmental change agent. I also love to race sailboats. </p>
